#Problem Description

## Problem Domain

The problem domain encompasses the visibility and accessibility of VCU sports information for students and the broader Richmond community. While VCU is recognized for its community engagement, students face challenges in staying informed about VCU sports, including tryouts, job openings, player stats, game schedules, and events. 

### Context and History

Richmond, known for its vibrant murals, also has a rich sports culture. However, the connection between VCU sports and students has not been fully realized. By providing a centralized resource, we aim to enhance awareness and participation in VCU sports.

## Need for a Database

A dedicated database is essential to address the communication gap between VCU sports and its community. This database will:

- Engage students with VCU sports.
- Raise awareness of VCU athletics in the Richmond area.
- Consolidate sports information in one accessible location, improving visibility for all stakeholders.

## Context, Scope, and Perspective

The database will serve various user roles, including athletes, coaches, sponsors, agents, and fans. Our goal is to ensure accessibility for everyone, creating a user-friendly platform. The database will cover:

- Score tracking and game results.
- Player and coach information.
- Statistics and contact details for student-athletes to facilitate professional opportunities.

## User Roles and Use Cases

### Student Athletes
- **Needs**: Access to upcoming games and personal/team stats.
- **Usage**: Check statistics, stay informed on other sports.

### Coaches
- **Needs**: Information on upcoming games and team performance.
- **Usage**: Update job openings and player information.

### Fans / Richmond Community
- **Needs**: Information on games, rosters, and results.
- **Usage**: Stay updated on events and job opportunities.

### Sponsors and Agents
- **Needs**: Access to athlete stats and community engagement metrics.
- **Usage**: Connect with athletes and teams for potential sponsorships and recruitment.

This database will facilitate new connections, potentially increasing VCU sports budgets and attracting more student-athletes through demonstrated professional opportunities.

## Security and Privacy

### Access Control
- All users (students, coaches, fans, sponsors, agents) can read the database.
- VCU admin can read and edit information after user authentication.

### Data Encryption
- Student-athlete contact information will be encrypted, accessible only to sponsors, agents, and coaches upon verification of their credentials.

The database will be publicly accessible, promoting transparency while safeguarding sensitive information.
